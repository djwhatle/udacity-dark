## Udacity Dark Theme
A dark theme for Udacity. As a Georgia Tech OMSCS student, I expect to spend a lot of time watching videos on Udacity in the next 2+ years. The themes I found on the internet were too aggressive in darkening *everything* on the site, so I resolved to make my own.

Note: I've made no attempt to make this CSS nice. This is quick and dirty, trial and error.

I tested this theme in Safari with Cascadea. Not sure if it will work in other browsers.
